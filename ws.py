# this is the file for doing the weak supervision.
## i'll have to think of someway to keep consistency between labeling functions.
### init a single point. and then like just return the call to find_fitness.
### very stupid. but at the same time. not stupid, if its not slow.

## use snorkel now to evaluate the long string of data that i have.

### will probably have to make helper functions to make sure to have the correct thresholds and stuff.
### but lol. like if I don't have helper functions. I will need helper functions. fuck. lol. Their is no way around it.
### well their is but helper functions is fast and quick and easy and won't have multiple versions of the functions themselves.




###### so now using that idea just need to use labeling functions to like do WS. see the accuracy...

##### lol how are we going to test the accuracy metric here. idk yet. well that is definetely still up for debate.
# I'm going to have to refresh myself on a lot of snorkel stuff.
